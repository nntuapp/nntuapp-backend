# NNTU app backend

This is a second version of a backend of our app.

## Previous Version
The first app backend was very simple and was written in PHP. The data was stored as .txt files and then was parsed right on devies. It had a negative impact on a structure of a timetable - it was hard to modify, it had a rigit structure, in a word - it wasn't universal. So we decided to rebuild all the timetable structure from the ground up with all-new timetable structure and all-new backend. 

## The new app backend
New backend uses Node.js and SQLite, it is more versatile and much more easier to modify. We think it is a step in a right direction, for sure.
